# Workshop
Welcome to the workshop, we're happy to have you.
In this workshop you can do antibody-antigen docking using HADDOCK3, de novo binding-protein design using RFdiffusion and nanobody design using RFantibody.
You can choose what you want to do!

You can start with either:
- 1.0 Binding-protein design, RFdiffusion
	- 2.0 Alphafold3
- 3.0 Antibody-Antigen docking, HADDOCK3
- 4.0 Nanobody design, RFantibody

------

## Install
To follow this workshops workflow, install the following, onto your laptop or computer:
- [PyMOL](https://www.pymol.org/).
- [MobaXterm home edition](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html).
	- Log in using the instructions laying around.


## Download
### 1.0 lets create your own folder:

Run the following, to get into the workshops folder containing everything you need to follow the workshop:
```bash
cd workshop
ls
```
Now you can chose to follow one of the modules I have prepared for you! 
- Binding-protein design, RFdiffusion: please follow these [instructions](RFdiffusion_AF3.md).
	- Alphafold3
- Antibody-Antigen docking, HADDOCK3: please follow these [instractions](Haddock3.md).
- Nanobody design, RFantibody: please follow these [instructions]().

Have fun, and dont hesitate to ask questions!
