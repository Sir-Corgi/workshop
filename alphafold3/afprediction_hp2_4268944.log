#### Alphafold3 module help ####
This module is intended for using Alphafold3 on GPUs with CUDA Capability 8 and higher (A40, 3g.40gb, 4g.40gb, A100)
For using Alphafold3 with GPUs with CUDA Capability 7.x (T4, 2080TIs), please use the module alphafold/cc7_3-20250304.lua

AlphaFold runs as a container while the database is stored on the shared scratch storage.
There is an alias for running alphafold which calls the appropriate run_alphafold.py script. 
It already takes care of binding /scratchdata, your /data1 directory and the databased directory
in the container.
You can just pass the options for run_alphafold.py that you need.

Example for using the existing database (adjust input_dir and output_dir as needed):
alphafold --db_dir=/data1/databases/AlphaFold3_resources/databases --model_dir=/data1/databases/AlphaFold3_resources/weights --input_dir=/data1/$USER/ --output_dir=/data1/$USER/

To see alphafold options, run:
alphafold --helpshort
or
alphafold --helpfull

2025-07-01 12:39:23.410725: W external/xla/xla/service/gpu/nvptx_compiler.cc:930] The NVIDIA driver's CUDA version is 12.5 which is older than the PTX compiler version 12.6.77. Because the driver is older than the PTX compiler version, XLA is disabling parallel compilation, which may slow down compilation. You should update your NVIDIA driver or use the NVIDIA-provided CUDA forward compatibility packages.
